# macOS App Management and Reporting Proof of Concept üì±üíª

This Proof of Concept (PoC) is designed to help you **manage installed applications** on macOS systems by automating the process of gathering app information, generating reports, and enabling app management tasks such as uninstalling outdated apps or updating installed ones.

## Features üöÄ

- **Gather Installed Apps**: Automatically fetch a list of all installed applications on macOS using `system_profiler`.
- **JSON Reporting**: Save the list of installed apps in a structured JSON format for easy reporting and viewing.
- **App Management**: Uninstall unwanted apps or run updates using Homebrew and macOS commands.
- **Web Reporting**: View installed apps in your browser using a simple Flask-based web interface.
- **Automation**: Script automated tasks like app removal or updates for efficient app management.

## Prerequisites ‚öôÔ∏è

To use this PoC, you‚Äôll need:

- macOS (tested on macOS 10.15 and above)
- Python 3.x
- Homebrew (for managing apps)
- Flask (for the web interface)

Install Flask with:

```bash
pip install flask
```

## Setup üõ†Ô∏è

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/macos-app-management-poc.git
   cd macos-app-management-poc
   ```

2. **Run the script to gather installed apps**:

   ```bash
   python get_installed_apps.py
   ```

   This will generate a `installed_apps.json` file containing a list of installed applications.

3. **View the report in the browser** (optional):

   ```bash
   python app_report.py
   ```

   Open `http://localhost:5000/apps` in your browser to view the installed apps.

4. **Manage apps**:
   - Use **Homebrew** to uninstall apps:
   
     ```bash
     brew uninstall <app_name>
     ```
   - Use **macOS commands** to remove system apps (admin access required):

     ```bash
     sudo rm -rf /Applications/<AppName>.app
     ```

## Example Usage üéØ

- **Generate a list of installed apps**:
  
  Run the following command to generate a structured report of all installed applications:

  ```bash
  python get_installed_apps.py
  ```

- **Uninstall an app** using the generated report:
  
  Locate the app in the `installed_apps.json` file and use the Homebrew or macOS command to remove it.

- **View app data** in your browser by running:

  ```bash
  python app_report.py
  ```

  This will display a list of installed apps at `http://localhost:5000/apps`.

## Future Enhancements üéÅ

- **Automated Updates**: Implement automatic updates for apps via Homebrew or Mac App Store CLI.
- **Notifications**: Add macOS notifications for critical app updates.
- **Scheduled Reports**: Schedule daily or weekly reports of installed apps and their statuses.
